                        SUNDAY

- update obj collision detection in key updating so simplifications can be made and gittering during collision goes away.

- Add user score sheet to show top three scores at end screen.

- Fix key handling - USE ex15 as example
    - Remove keys to control robot arm...
    - New key mods:
        - Enable/Disable following camera (Allow for user to left click and drag to move camera?)

- Check lighting for each shape

- Add buttons to get back to main menu/replay at game over

- Add clickable buttons to scroll through items, obstacles, or robots in the view GAME_MODE

_________________________________________________________________________________

- Add more lights to randomly walk ("float") around scene. Will want to use struct to control and visualize lights.

- Fix FPS handling to whatever example 24 does

- Make robot arm more interesting:
    - Add teeth to gripper
    - Make links more interesting shape than cubic links (attempt Braccio)
    - Add plates (similar to legs)

- Get rid of vent texture on runner and make body cooler

- Make items more interesting

- Add bump map to wall obstacles and use wood planks for box

- RRT*/A* for chaser to move around obstacles to get runner robot with spheres as waypoints 
    - As chaser reaches waypoints, delete them (set waypoint state to "REACHED" or "NOT_REACHED," similar to items)

                        MONDAY

- Add ability for user to add walls behind them

- Add wireframe bounding box to Robot struct for visulization
    - Will require algorithm to calculate the max/min of robots at all timesteps
    - Can be used for OBB collision detection

- Implement OBB detection for obstacles (use for overlapping and for robot cubic boundary)

- Redo code: reduce global variables and make c files implentations for headers
    - Reduce headers

- Update README with keyhandles and background/theory

                        STRETCH

- Add ground scene with texture.
